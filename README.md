## FAQ

### What version of iOS does this app support?

#### iOS 9.1+

### Why can't you share information with Facebook?

#### Unfortunately, Facebook does not allow you to prepopulate text fields with information, so it's up to you to put something meaningful in there. Sorry.

### Why is there a folder called Brisbane Fireworks in the project but the app is called QLD Fireworks?

#### Because I originally thought the dataset was only for Brisbane but it was actually for the whole of Queensland.

### Is this App available on Apple's App Store?

#### Yes and it available [here](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/qld-fireworks/id1267664489).

### In your [pitch video](https://youtu.be/ujNKVBgv_Vs) you mention FOMO. What is FOMO?

#### Fear Of Missing Out. ([urbandictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fomo))

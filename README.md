## FAQ

### What version of iOS does this app support?

#### iOS 9.1+

### Why is the project file called Brisbane Fireworks but the app is called QLD Fireworks?

#### Because I originally thought the dataset was only for Brisbane but was actually for the whole of Queensland.

### Will you be submitting this to the App Store?

#### Yes. When finished it will be submitted to Apple's App Store under my account.
